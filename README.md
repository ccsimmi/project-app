# project-app
I have found an app design on dribbble and this is my attempt to recreate the designs using pure HTML and CSS. 
This project is my first attempt at utilising the technologies of: HTML, CSS3, GIT and GitHub.
The aims of this project is to: 
1) attempt to understand GIT by utilsiing it in a project
2) understand how far my CSS layout skills have progressed
NB: I have been coding for just over a month at the start of this project.
NB2: https://dribbble.com/shots/9730914-Wallie-Digital-Wallet is the link to the project I am recreating
