# project-app
I have found an app design on dribbble and this is my attempt to recreate the designs using pure HTML and CSS. 
This project is my first attempt at utilising the technologies of: HTML, CSS3, GIT and GitHub.
The aims of this project is to: 
1) attempt to understand GIT by utilsiing it in a project
2) understand how far my CSS layout skills have progressed
 
Notes
1) I have been coding for just over a month at the start of this project.
2) https://dribbble.com/shots/9730914-Wallie-Digital-Wallet is the link to the project I am recreating

UPDATE(27/01/2020): 
1) Since I am trying to learn Javascript, I am finding it difficult to try and finish off all 3 app screen designs. Instead I will focus on screen 1 for now and keep the other two screens within their branches. I shall return to them soon.
2) I have learnt so much about GIT and using it as part of my workflow. I am very happy that my understanding of this technology can be put to use. I am confident I have utilised the technology enough for me to use GIT in colloboration with others.
